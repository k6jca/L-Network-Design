# L-Network-Design
Tools for the Design of L-Networks

The EXCEL File, "L-Network Design Spreadsheet 26Sept22.xlsx", will give all possible L-Networks 
(either series-parallel and/or parallel-series configurations) that transform a given 
complex load impedance (Zload = Rload + jXload) to a complex input impedance (Zin = Rin + jXin).  
Note that Zin is the impedance looking into an L-Network that is terminated with Zload.
